Got it — you want an **explainer** for AcademicChain that:

1. Clearly lays out **how it works** in plain language.
2. Shows the **user flow** visually/textually.
3. Explains a **simplified smart contract logic**.
4. Shows **how CAM Network Origin SDK** would be integrated.

Here’s how I’d structure it:

---

## **📖 What is AcademicChain?**

**AcademicChain** is a blockchain-powered platform that leverages Camp Network's Origin Protocol to:

* **Register academic papers** as verifiable digital assets on-chain
* **Track citations** between papers with transparent verification
* **Distribute royalties** automatically when papers are cited or accessed
* **Verify ownership** and provide immutable proof of publication dates

---

### **🔄 User Flow**

1. **Register Research**

   * Researcher uploads their paper.
   * Metadata (title, abstract, authors, institution) stored on-chain.
   * File stored on IPFS/Arweave with CID saved in the smart contract.
   * Proof of ownership timestamped on blockchain.

2. **Control Access**

   * Researcher sets access policy (public, paid access, institutional access).
   * Smart contract enforces access permissions.
   * Payments for access are routed via blockchain.

3. **Track Citations**

   * Citations are logged by integrating with academic databases or blockchain-based citation registry.
   * Each citation increases the author’s “impact score” stored on-chain.

4. **Distribute Royalties**

   * Payments for access are automatically split between:

     * Primary author(s)
     * Co-authors
     * Affiliated institution(s)
   * Done via a smart contract’s **split payment function**.

---

## **💡 Smart Contract Architecture**

AcademicChain consists of three main smart contracts that work together:

### 1. **ResearchPaper.sol** - ERC721 Token for Papers

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721URIStorage.sol";
import "./interfaces/IOriginProtocol.sol";
import "./CitationRegistry.sol";

contract ResearchPaper is ERC721URIStorage, Ownable {
    struct Paper {
        string ipfsHash;       // IPFS link to the paper
        address researcher;    // Original author
        uint256 publishDate;   // Timestamp of registration
        string title;          // Paper title
        string[] keywords;     // Research keywords
        uint256 citationCount; // Number of citations
        bool isVerified;       // Verification status
    }
    
    mapping(uint256 => Paper) public papers;
    CitationRegistry public citationRegistry;
    IOriginProtocol public originProtocol;
    
    // Register new research paper
    function registerPaper(
        string memory _ipfsHash,
        string memory _title,
        string memory _tokenURI,
        string[] memory _keywords
    ) external returns (uint256) {
        // Mint NFT for paper & register with Origin Protocol
        // Return the new paper ID
    }
    
    // Cite another paper
    function citePaper(uint256 _citingPaperId, uint256 _citedPaperId) external {
        // Record citation and distribute royalties
    }
}
```

### 2. **CitationRegistry.sol** - Citation Tracking

```solidity
contract CitationRegistry is Ownable {
    struct Citation {
        uint256 citationId;      
        uint256 citingPaperId;   // Paper that is citing
        uint256 citedPaperId;    // Paper being cited
        address citer;           
        uint256 timestamp;       
        bool isVerified;         
    }
    
    // Maps paperId to arrays of citation IDs where it's cited
    mapping(uint256 => uint256[]) private paperCitations;
    
    // Record a citation between papers
    function recordCitation(
        uint256 _citingPaperId, 
        uint256 _citedPaperId, 
        address _citer
    ) external returns (uint256) {
        // Create citation record and return ID
    }
    
    // Get citation count for a paper
    function getCitationCount(uint256 _paperId) external view returns (uint256) {
        return paperCitations[_paperId].length;
    }
}
```

### 3. **RoyaltyDistributor.sol** - Payment Handling

```solidity
contract RoyaltyDistributor is Ownable, ReentrancyGuard {
    struct RoyaltyPayment {
        uint256 paymentId;      
        uint256 paperId;        
        address researcher;     
        uint256 amount;         
        uint256 timestamp;      
        address payer;          
        string reason;          
    }
    
    IOriginProtocol public originProtocol;
    
    // Pay royalty for a paper citation
    function payRoyalty(
        uint256 _paperId,
        address _researcher,
        string memory _reason
    ) external payable returns (uint256) {
        // Verify ownership via Origin Protocol
        // Calculate platform fee
        // Transfer funds to researcher
        // Record payment with Origin Protocol
    }
}
```

✅ This architecture provides:

* **Paper Registration** with NFT ownership proof
* **Citation Tracking** with verification
* **Automated Royalty Distribution** with platform fee handling

## **📡 Camp Network Origin SDK Integration**

AcademicChain integrates with **Camp Network Origin SDK** for enhanced functionality:

### Key Integration Points

* **Asset Registration** - Register papers as verifiable digital assets
* **Ownership Verification** - Validate paper ownership claims
* **IP Protection** - Secure intellectual property rights
* **Royalty Management** - Distribute payments automatically

### Integration Flow

1. Researcher connects wallet to dApp which interfaces with Camp Network
2. Paper is hashed and registered with Origin Protocol
3. Origin Protocol returns verification that's stored on-chain
4. When papers are cited, Origin Protocol verifies ownership
5. Royalties are distributed through Origin Protocol's payment system

### Code Integration Example

```javascript
import { OriginSDK } from '@camp-network/origin-sdk';

class AcademicChainService {
  constructor() {
    this.originSDK = new OriginSDK({
      chainId: 123420001114,  // Basecamp network
      rpcUrl: 'https://rpc.basecamp.t.raas.gelato.cloud'
    });
  }
  
  async registerPaper(file, metadata, account) {
    // 1. Upload file to IPFS
    const ipfsHash = await this.uploadToIPFS(file);
    
    // 2. Register with Origin Protocol
    const assetId = await this.originSDK.registerAsset({
      assetType: 'RESEARCH_PAPER',
      contentHash: ipfsHash,
      creator: account.address,
      metadata: {
        title: metadata.title,
        keywords: metadata.keywords,
        abstract: metadata.abstract
      }
    });
    
    // 3. Register in ResearchPaper contract
    const contract = new ethers.Contract(
      RESEARCH_PAPER_ADDRESS,
      ResearchPaperABI,
      account.signer
    );
    
    const tx = await contract.registerPaper(
      ipfsHash,
      metadata.title,
      `ipfs://${ipfsHash}/metadata.json`,
      metadata.keywords
    );
    
    return { tx, assetId };
  }
  
  async citePaper(citingPaperId, citedPaperId, account) {
    // 1. Verify ownership through Origin Protocol
    const isOwner = await this.originSDK.verifyOwnership(citingPaperId, account.address);
    if (!isOwner) throw new Error('Not the paper owner');
    
    // 2. Create citation in contract
    const contract = new ethers.Contract(
      RESEARCH_PAPER_ADDRESS,
      ResearchPaperABI,
      account.signer
    );
    
    return contract.citePaper(citingPaperId, citedPaperId);
  }
}
```
